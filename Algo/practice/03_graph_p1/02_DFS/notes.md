## DFS

- DFS looks like in order traversal on Binary Tree
- BFF looks like order traversal on tree

- recurion levels of difficulty
- tally recursion: factorial
- chain recursion: fabonatchi or binary tree
- DFS: has list of neigbours, cycles
- DP:

- Time Complexity
  - DFS: N + M (node and edges)
  - Binary Tree (N + 2 N) node + edges = ~ 3N ~ N
