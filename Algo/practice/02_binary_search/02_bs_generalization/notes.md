### Binary Search Generalization

Binary Search on array

- So far we learned how to use binary search on a sorted array
  - Check if a number exists
  - Return the first index for the occurrence of a number
  - Return the first last for the occurrence of a number
- Most of the binary search problems are on monotonic function not just sorted
  arrays
- We will discuss a problem and show its code
  - This style of formatting the code is almost the same
