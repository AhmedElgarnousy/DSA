### Binary Search

- binary search educational case
- why this called binary search ?

  - 2^8 = 256 , 2^7 = 128

- leetcode_441_coins
- bs generalization
  - IF we can convert then the numbers from 1 to n
    - to T T T and F F F and choose the last T it will be the answer
    - theses virtual vector so we didn't create a vector of boolean values
    - just we have a indicator to search the right or left
    - actually we have the vector from 0, 1, ..., n
- monotonic fuction

// how to answer that is this binary search problem or not ?

- correctness
