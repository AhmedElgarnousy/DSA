## Algorithms

### What is Algorithm

- The word ==“algorithm”== is actually derived from a Latinized version of Al-Khwarizmi’s name.

- ==well-defined computional procedure take an input(value or set of values) and transforms that to desired output in a finite amount of time==.
  - Computational problem. Such as Decision, Search, Counting and Optimization problems
  - Tip: Any procedure(function) is an algorithm, but in CS we typically mean computational problems
- Algorithm may be correct or incorrect depending on desired output, but efficieny play an important role.(cost, temperature server)

###### Little History: The father of Algorithm

- Muḥammad ibn [`Mūsā al-Khwārizmī`](https://www.lowellmilkencenter.org/programs/projects/view/muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizmi/hero) was a Persian polymath(عالم فارسي متعدد العلوم)
- produced vastly influential works in `mathematics`, `astronomy`, and `geography`
- presented `the first systematic solution` of `linear and quadratic equations` (_algorithms_)
- considered the `founder of algebra`

  - The term algebra itself comes from the title of his book...

> "When I consider what people generally want in calculating, I've found that is is always a number."

Even if you’re not looking at complex mathematical formulas every day, you’re surrounded by them. Algorithms covertly drive even our most routine daily activities like taking an UberPool, using Spotify Discover playlists and typing something on Google.

#### why we interseted in algorithms

**Daily life application**

- web browsers
- music players
- movie ticket booking apps
- autonomous driving
- etc..

#### Algorithms content

- Sorting
- binary search

#### Other types of Algorithms

- Example: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
  - Given an email, how can we know if it is a spam?
  - Given an image, specify if there is a chair in image or not.

Therefore, it behooves you to understand algorithms not just as a student or
practitioner of computer science, but as a citizen of the world. Once you understand
algorithms, you can educate others about what algorithms are, how they operate,
and what their limitations are.
